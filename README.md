# PythonLab
This repository includes Python essentials. 
It is commonly stated that 80% of the work of data scientists is data preparation. Managing research data was a course in which I learned how to focus on the
concepts and skills needed to perform the steps needed to prepare data for analysis, as well as document data
for preservation and reuse. These include:
• Data cleaning
• Data integration
• Data selection
• Data transformation
• Data reduction

I completed these assignments and they helped me grasp the essentials of Python. To access solutions, please reach out to me!
